# Formalization of Computability Theory

An ongoing effort to formalize computability theory via partial recursive sets, rather than functions.

- Primitive recursive (PR), computable (Comp), and partial recursive (computably enumerable) (CE) sets are all defined
-  PR -> Comp -> CE
- â„•, the empty set, singletons, finite, and cofinite sets are primitive recursive
- PR, Comp, and CE are closed under union and intersection
- PR and Comp are closed under complement and set difference
- CE is closed under set difference by Comp sets
- CE is closed under finite symmetric difference


To do:
- symmetric difference lemmas for PR and Comp
- classical definitions involving set operations: immunity, cohesiveness, major subsets
- the relativized arithmetic hierarchy
